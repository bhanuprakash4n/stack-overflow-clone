# Stackoverflow
## Prototype of Stackoverflow application

* This is a clone of Stackoverflow web application
* I developed a 3-tier distributed web application with message queues as middleware and scaled horizontally to handle a load of 10,000 users simultaneously.
* I had ensured high performance throughout the application using Redis caching and utilized Pub/Sub architecture for performing asynchronous tasks. Implemented token-based authentication for the REST services using PassportJs.
* This is developed using the MERN stack along with Apache Kafka, AWS, Redux and MySQL.
